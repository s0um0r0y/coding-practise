    '''
    Trains a PyTorch model for a single epoch.

    Turns a target PyTorch model to training mode and then
    runs through all of the required training steps (forward
    pass, loss calculation, optimizer step).

    Args:
        model: A PyTorch model to be trained.
        dataloader: A DataLoader instance for the model to be trained on.
        loss_fn: A PyTorch loss function to minimize.
        optimizer: A PyTorch optimizer to help minimize the loss function.
        device: A target device to compute on (e.g. "cuda" or "cpu").

    Returns:
        A tuple of training loss and training accuracy metrics.
        In the form (train_loss, train_accuracy). For example:

        Trains and tests a PyTorch model.

    Passes a target PyTorch models through train_step() and test_step()
    functions for a number of epochs, training and testing the model
    in the same epoch loop.

    Calculates, prints and stores evaluation metrics throughout.

    Args:
        model: A PyTorch model to be trained and tested.
        train_dataloader: A DataLoader instance for the model to be trained on.
        test_dataloader: A DataLoader instance for the model to be tested on.
        optimizer: A PyTorch optimizer to help minimize the loss function.
        loss_fn: A PyTorch loss function to calculate loss on both datasets.
        epochs: An integer indicating how many epochs to train for.
        device: A target device to compute on (e.g. "cuda" or "cpu").

    Returns:
        A dictionary of training and testing loss as well as training and
        testing accuracy metrics. Each metric has a value in a list for 
        each epoch.
